The design draws inspiration from 2025 trends in virtual try-on apps, such as clean, intuitive interfaces that boost engagement and conversions through personalized recommendations and AR integration. Colors, fonts, and layouts remain consistent: soft blue accents, Roboto/Open Sans fonts, responsive grids, and subtle animations for a polished, professional look similar to leading apps like those from Banuba or Auglio.
