Authentication and User Profile:

Signup page: Form with email, password, username. Validate inputs (e.g., strong password). On submit, send to backend API (/signup) to hash password (bcrypt) and store in MongoDB.
Login page: Form with email/password. On success, generate JWT token, store in localStorage, redirect to homepage.
Profile page: Protected route (use auth middleware). Display user details, stored body measurements (e.g., chest, shoulders in a table), favorite products (list with images/links), and past fit analyses (e.g., "Shirt X: Too Tight - Suggested Size L").
Logout: Clear token and redirect to login.


Homepage:

Hero section with app description: "FitPredict uses AI to measure your body, predict clothing fits, and let you try-on virtually – reducing returns by up to 30%!"
Buttons: "Get Started" (to measurements), "Login/Signup".
If logged in, show personalized welcome and quick links to profile/measurements.


Body Measurements Module:

Page: "/measurements" (protected).
Options: Real-time camera or image upload (front, back, side views).
Real-time: Use MediaPipe Pose to detect landmarks, OpenCV for video capture and face blurring. Calculate measurements (e.g., shoulder width, chest) with reference scaling (e.g., credit card).
Image Upload: Allow multiple uploads (front/back/side). Process with OpenCV/MediaPipe to extract measurements.
Store in MongoDB under user ID (e.g., {userId: ObjectId, measurements: {chest_cm: 100, shoulders_cm: 45}}).
Display results immediately and save to profile.


Product Fit Prediction Module:

Page: "/fit-predict" (protected).
User inputs: Upload clothing image, enter description (e.g., "Medium shirt, chest 98 cm"), or URL (scrape size chart).
Processing:

For image: Use YOLO to detect clothing/product, crop size labels, use Tesseract-OCR to extract dimensions.
For description/URL: Parse text or scrape (BeautifulSoup) for sizes.


Compare with stored measurements (rule-based: ±2 cm tolerance).
Output: Fit status, detailed comparison (e.g., "Chest: Too Tight by 3 cm").
If not fit, generate suggestions (e.g., "Try size L" or recommend similar products via mock API).


AR Visualization Module:

Integrated into fit-predict page or separate "/ar-tryon".
Use stored measurements for scaling.
Real-time webcam: Detect body landmarks (MediaPipe), overlay uploaded product image on body (warp/resize using OpenCV in ML service).
Show visual feedback: Green outline for perfect fit, red for mismatches.
If fit issues, display changes needed (e.g., "Adjust for larger shoulders").


Favorites and Recommendations:

On fit-predict page: Button to "Favorite" product (store in MongoDB: {userId, product: {imageUrl, description, fitAnalysis}}).
Recommendations: Based on body size, suggest alternatives (e.g., query mock DB or external API for similar items).
View in profile: List favorites with AR preview option.


Database Schema (MongoDB):

Users: { _id: ObjectId, email: String, password: String, username: String }
Measurements: { userId: ObjectId, chest_cm: Number, shoulders_cm: Number, ... }
Favorites: { userId: ObjectId, products: Array of {name: String, imageUrl: String, fitStatus: String, analysis: String} }
Analyses: { userId: ObjectId, productId: String, fitDetails: Object }


Backend APIs:

/auth/signup: POST - Create user.
/auth/login: POST - Authenticate and return JWT.
/measurements: POST - Save measurements; GET - Fetch for user.
/fit-predict: POST - Send product data to ML service, return prediction.
/ar-tryon: POST - Stream AR overlay (use WebSockets if needed for real-time).
/favorites: POST - Add favorite; GET - Fetch list.
Use middleware for JWT auth on protected routes.


ML Service (Python):

Endpoints: /measure (process video/image for measurements), /detect-product (YOLO + OCR), /predict-fit (comparison logic), /ar-overlay (generate overlaid frames).
Run as separate server (e.g., Flask), called by Node.js backend.


Frontend Structure (React):

Components: Navbar (with login/logout), SignupForm, LoginForm, ProfileDashboard, MeasurementsCapture (with webcam/image upload), FitPredictForm, ARTryOn (webcam overlay).
Routing: Use React Router (/, /signup, /login, /profile, /measurements, /fit-predict, /ar-tryon).
State Management: Redux or Context API for user auth and measurements.
Camera Access: Use react-webcam library.
AR: Render video stream with overlays using Canvas or HTML5 video.


Security and Best Practices:

Authentication: JWT with expiration.
Privacy: Face blurring in ML service; no raw image storage.
Error Handling: Graceful errors (e.g., "No landmarks detected").
Responsiveness: Mobile-friendly UI.
Testing: Unit tests for components/APIs; integration tests for ML flows.
