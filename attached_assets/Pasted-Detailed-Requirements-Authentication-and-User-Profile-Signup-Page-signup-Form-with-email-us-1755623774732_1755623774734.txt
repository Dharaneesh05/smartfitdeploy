Detailed Requirements:

Authentication and User Profile:

Signup Page (/signup): Form with email, username, password, confirm password, and terms checkbox. Validate inputs (e.g., email format, password strength). Backend API (/auth/signup) hashes passwords (bcrypt) and stores in MongoDB.
Login Page (/login): Form with email/password. Return JWT token on success, store in localStorage, redirect to homepage.
Profile Page (/profile) – Protected:

Display username, email, and sections for:

Measurements: Table of stored dimensions (e.g., chest, shoulders) with date measured and "Export Data" (CSV/JSON) button.
Favorites: Grid of favorited products (image, name, fit status, "View AR" or "Remove" buttons).
Saved Analysis: List of past fit predictions (product, date, fit details, recommendations).
Recommendations: Personalized product suggestions based on measurements (e.g., "Size L shirts for your chest").
History: Timeline of user actions (e.g., measurements, predictions).


Logout: Button with confirmation modal ("Are you sure?").
Delete Account: Option to delete all user data (measurements, favorites, analysis).




Homepage (/) – Public:

Hero Section: Full-width (400px height), soft blue gradient background. Title: "FitPredict: Shop Smarter, Return Less" (48px Roboto bold). Description: "AI measures your body, predicts clothing fits, offers AR try-on, and suggests perfect products to reduce returns by up to 30%!" (20px Open Sans gray). Blue "Get Started" button linking to measurements.
How It Works: Three cards (flex-row, 300px height):

Step 1: "Measure Body" – Real-time camera or image upload with guided instructions.
Step 2: "Predict Fit" – Upload product image, description, or URL for AI analysis.
Step 3: "AR Try-On & Recommendations" – Visualize fit and get personalized suggestions.


Featured Recommendations: Carousel of 3-5 product cards (image, name, "Why it fits: Matches average measurements", "Try Now" button). Personalized if logged in.
Footer: "© 2025 FitPredict", social icons (LinkedIn, X), language toggle, dark mode toggle.


Body Measurements Module (/measurements) – Protected:

Real-Time Camera:

Instructions: Display dynamic overlays on webcam feed (e.g., green bounding box: "Stand fully in frame", red text: "Move back 1 meter", yellow arrow: "Turn to side"). Use MediaPipe to check if user is centered and at correct distance (e.g., landmarks within frame, shoulder width >100px for scale).
Front View: Detect landmarks (MediaPipe Pose, 33 points). Show progress: "Detecting front view..." (spinner). After ~5 seconds of stable detection, alert: "Front view captured! Please turn to side" (green toast).
Side View: Detect side landmarks (e.g., shoulder-to-hip). Conclude measurements (e.g., chest, shoulders, waist). Scale using reference object (e.g., credit card width=8.6cm).
Face Blurring: Apply Gaussian blur to face region in real-time using MediaPipe Face Detection.


Image Upload:

Three dropzones: "Front View", "Back View", "Side View" (300x300 each). Process with MediaPipe/OpenCV to extract measurements. Blur faces in uploaded images.


Output: Display measurements (e.g., "Chest: 100 cm", "Shoulders: 45 cm"). Save to MongoDB under user ID. Button: "View in Profile" or "Get Recommendations".
Privacy Note: "Faces blurred, no images stored."


Fit Prediction Module (/fit-predict) – Protected:

Input Options:

Product Image: Upload (300x300 dropzone). Use YOLOv8 to detect clothing and crop size labels, Tesseract-OCR to extract dimensions (e.g., "Chest: 98 cm").
Description: Textarea for manual entry (e.g., "Medium shirt, chest 98 cm"). Parse with regex/spaCy.
URL: Input for e-commerce link (e.g., Amazon). Scrape size chart with BeautifulSoup.


Prediction: Compare product dimensions to stored measurements (rule-based: ±2 cm tolerance). Output: Badge (e.g., green "Perfect Fit"), table (e.g., "Body Chest: 100 cm, Product: 98 cm, Difference: -2 cm").
Save Analysis: Store results in MongoDB (e.g., {userId, product, fitDetails, date}).
Favorites: "Add to Favorites" button (saves product image, name, fit status).


Product Suggestions and Recommendations:

On Fit Predict Page: If not a perfect fit, show "Recommendations" section with 3-5 cards (image, name, size, "Why? Matches your chest within 1 cm"). Use mock API or scraped data (e.g., Amazon-like catalog).
Dedicated Recommendations Page (/recommendations):

Grid (3 columns desktop, 1 mobile) of personalized products based on measurements and past analyses.
Filters: Category (shirts, pants), Fit Type (tight, loose).
Buttons per card: "Add to Favorites", "Try AR", "Buy Now" (mock link to external e-commerce).


Backend Logic: Query MongoDB for user measurements, match against product database (e.g., {product: {name, size, chest_cm}}). Prioritize near-perfect fits (e.g., ±1 cm).


AR Visualization Module (/ar-tryon) – Protected:

Real-Time Webcam: Use react-webcam and MediaPipe to detect body landmarks. Overlay uploaded product image (scaled using stored measurements, e.g., shoulder width). Highlight fit: Green for perfect, red for mismatches.
Instructions: Same as measurements (e.g., "Stand in frame", "Turn to side" for dynamic overlay).
Controls: Dropdown to select product (from uploaded or favorites). "Save This Look" (stores AR snapshot/analysis). "View Recommendations" (links to suggestions based on AR fit).
Feedback: Dynamic text: "Looks great!" or "Too tight on chest – try recommended size L".


Database Schema (MongoDB):

Users: { _id: ObjectId, email: String, username: String, password: String }
Measurements: { userId: ObjectId, chest_cm: Number, shoulders_cm: Number, waist_cm: Number, date: Date }
Favorites: { userId: ObjectId, products: [{ name: String, imageUrl: String, fitStatus: String, size: String }] }
Analyses: { userId: ObjectId, product: { name, imageUrl }, fitDetails: { chest: String, shoulders: String }, recommendations: [String], date: Date }
Recommendations: { userId: ObjectId, products: [{ name, imageUrl, size, chest_cm, why: String }] }
History: { userId: ObjectId, actions: [{ action: String, date: Date }] }


Backend APIs (Node.js/Express):

/auth/signup: POST – Create user, hash password.
/auth/login: POST – Return JWT.
/measurements: POST – Save measurements; GET – Fetch for user.
/fit-predict: POST – Send product data to ML service, return fit prediction and recommendations.
/ar-tryon: POST – Stream AR frames (use WebSockets for real-time).
/favorites: POST – Add favorite; GET – Fetch list; DELETE – Remove.
/recommendations: GET – Fetch personalized products based on measurements.
/history: GET – Fetch user action history.
Middleware: JWT authentication for protected routes.


ML Service (Python/FastAPI):

Endpoints:

/measure: Process video/image for measurements (MediaPipe/OpenCV, face blurring).
/detect-product: YOLOv8 for clothing detection, Tesseract-OCR for size extraction.
/predict-fit: Compare measurements, return fit status and suggestions.
/ar-overlay: Generate overlaid frames for AR (scaled with measurements).


Instructions Logic: Check landmark positions (e.g., shoulders within frame center ±10%, distance >100px). Return JSON: { status: "in_frame", message: "Stand fully in frame" }.
Dependencies: opencv-python, mediapipe, ultralytics (YOLOv8), pytesseract, numpy.
